# Life-Expectancy
## Life expectancy is a statistical indicator that shows how long the members of a society live on average, or in other words, how long they are expected to live. The average lifespan of people in a society depends on many factors such as health and economic issues.

According to online news, the average life expectancy of Iranians is about 76 years. In this exercise, we are going to predict the average life expectancy of the residents of different countries by using features such as gross national product (GDP), the rate of death at a young age, the prevalence of the AIDS virus and other diseases.

Although the purpose of this exercise is only to predict "life expectancy", you can compare the characteristics of each country for the purpose of "Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA". For example, you can measure the impact of GDP on life expectancy! Exploratory data analysis is no exception to this question and has no points in the judging process, but it is useful for your intuition as a data scientist and can help in feature engineering!
